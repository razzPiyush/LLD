Definition:
The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface to create families of related or
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates a group of individual factories with a
common theme.

When to Use:
-When you need to create families of related objects that must be used together.
-When the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
-When you want to enforce consistency among related objects.
-When the product families are expected to grow, and you want to ensure that adding new product families doesnâ€™t affect
existing code.
