/*
-The Null Object Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a default or "do-nothing" behavior in place
of null references. It avoids null checks in the code by creating an object with a neutral (non-impactful) behavior.

When to Use:
-When you want to eliminate repetitive if (object != null) checks in the code.
-When you need a default implementation that doesnâ€™t affect the overall functionality.
-When you want to treat null as a valid object with a neutral behavior, ensuring seamless interaction with other objects.
